# SimpleArchISO - A Custom Arch Linux ISO

This repository contains files and instructions for building a custom Arch Linux ISO.
The pre-built ISO is hosted on Google Drive due to its large file size.

## Downloading the Custom Arch Linux ISO

Due to its large file size (approximately 2.1 GB), the `simplearch.iso` file is hosted on Google Drive instead of directly in this GitHub repository. We've provided a dedicated Python script to simplify the download process for you.

**The correct Google Drive ID for the ISO is: `1IcbAk4yFh9VodGMuYMKWUhMA6tBjUSfc`**

Follow these steps to download the ISO:

### 1. Get the Download Script

The Python download script (`download-gdrive.py`) is located in a separate GitHub repository. You need to clone that repository to get the script onto your machine.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/rainbownx/Google-drive-install-script.git](https://github.com/rainbownx/Google-drive-install-script.git)
cd Google-drive-install-script

You will now be inside the Google-drive-install-script directory.
2. Install Python Prerequisites

The download script requires the requests Python library to function.

    For Arch Linux users:
    Bash

sudo pacman -S python-requests

For other Linux distributions or general Python environments:
Bash

    pip install requests

3. Download the ISO using the Script

Once you are inside the Google-drive-install-script directory (from Step 1) and have installed the necessary Python library (Step 2), you can run the script to download the ISO.

The full Google Drive shareable link for your simplearch.iso is:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IcbAk4yFh9VodGMuYMKWUhMA6tBjUSfc/view?usp=sharing

Important: You can specify where you want to save the ISO file on your system.

    To download to your current directory (the Google-drive-install-script folder):
    The file will be saved with its original filename (likely simplearch.iso) in the directory you are currently in.
    Bash

python download-gdrive.py "[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IcbAk4yFh9VodGMuYMKWUhMA6tBjUSfc/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IcbAk4yFh9VodGMuYMKWUhMA6tBjUSfc/view?usp=sharing)"

To download to a specific directory (e.g., your system's Downloads folder):
The file will be saved with its original filename (likely simplearch.iso) in the specified directory.
Bash

python download-gdrive.py "[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IcbAk4yFh9VodGMuYMKWUhMA6tBjUSfc/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IcbAk4yFh9VodGMuYMKWUhMA6tBjUSfc/view?usp=sharing)" ~/Downloads/

To download with a specific filename and path (e.g., to /tmp/custom_arch.iso):
This gives you full control over the file's name and location.
Bash

    python download-gdrive.py "[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IcbAk4yFh9VodGMuYMKWUhMA6tBjUSfc/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IcbAk4yFh9VodGMuYMKWUhMA6tBjUSfc/view?usp=sharing)" /tmp/custom_arch.iso

After running the command, the script will download the simplearch.iso file to your specified location.
Then go to your specified location in a file manager and open the copied file and download the iso file via the website that the file is linked to.
If you see a error messages saying "Google Drive can't scan this file for viruses." just click download anyway and start downloading the iso file.
